# Intro_to_Robotics
Homework assignments for Professor Tron's ME 416 Robotics class.  
In this course, we learned how to use the Robot Operating System. We also used Python to control a robot with a Raspberry Pi, and used OpenCV to train a simple model and used the model to autonomously drive the robot in an obstacle course.
